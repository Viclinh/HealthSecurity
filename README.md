Inspiration

We have a health app and we collect personal information from customers. We would like to protect our health system and network by connecting our app with Microsoft Sentinel to detect any cyber security threats.
What it does

    It provides a workbook that can provide visualized charts for the metrics and show what the data relationship or changes look like.
    Log Analytics that can show data in graphs and display any potential threats to the targeted nodes
    Hunting Queries that can help us figure out what happens

How we built it

We developed all of the workbooks, log analytics, and hunting queries using Microsoft Azure Sentinel platform
Challenges we ran into

We had challenges to learn about Microsoft Sentinel and its functions. We also struggled to figure out the access privileges that the data connectors require.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to figure out functions and features of Microsoft Sentinel and finish our project presentation.
